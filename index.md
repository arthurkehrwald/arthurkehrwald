### Summary
This pinball machine has a futuristic twist: Using a transparent TV screen, it projects a virtual ball onto a 3D printed playfield, making it look as though it collides with the real objects underneath. The project was started this semester and is still being worked on.

### Features
* Hardware
  * Transparent Screen
  * 3D printed playfield
  * Plunger with ultrasonic sensor
  * Arcade style buttons
  * **Beer Holder (!!!)**
* Software 
  * Off-Axis Camera Projection ([Off-Axis-What?!](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Projection_for_Virtual_Reality#Off-Axis_vs._On-Axis_Perspective_Projection))
  * Face Tracking (matches game perspective with player perspective)
  * Fully modular game programming (no interdependent objects)

In “Tukki & Champ” a chameleon rides a toucan and they compete for food in an asymmetrical, local 2-player matchup. One player takes the keyboard and controls the bird while the other uses the mouse to aim the chameleon's tongue.

This is a personal project I used to learn the basics of C++ and graph data structures. It works like this: Each puzzle consists of a set of connected buttons, represented by coloured rectangles. Each cross in the table indicates a connection between two buttons. When a button is pressed, all connected buttons (but not the one that was pressed) change colour in the cycle Red -> Green -> Blue -> Red. The goal is to "sync" the graph such that all buttons have the same colour. As seen above, the game can alternatively be visualized as a graph, but I chose to use a matrix because I wanted to focus on the graph implementation and C++ rather than the UI.
